## Preserve

We keep the WARCs and log files from all the crawlers, in a folder structure that reflects the crawl process. We keep content obtained under different terms in separate folders. For example, openly available Non-Print Legal Deposit material is separate from material that we obtained by permission, or from behind a paywall.
